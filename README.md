# FocusHQ React Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`

Install all dependencies of the application.

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## In Order to Test the Application

In the `App.js` file, to force and error on the application, change or remove a char in the fetch url.

## The Challenge

- How did you decide on the technical and architectural choices used as part of your solution?

> Before I started, I read carefully the instructions to be sure that I am in the right way. Deciding technical and architectural choice is not that hard since the app is not that complex. Though I followed the standard convention in react, naming it by its purpose, as much as possible make it reusable and never make it 2 or more levels deep. Also, used functional component since it's less code and much easier to read because they arre just plain javascript functions without state or lifecycle hooks, also you can do as much as class base with the hooks feature.

- Are there any improvements you could make to your submission?

> If possible, the improvements that I could've add is more on the UI part, added animations to make it more elegant.

- What would you do differently if you were allocated more time?

> I might use React UI Libraries such as https://ant.design/ or https://semantic-ui.com/ but as per instructions, no using of other dependencies. Also might add animations.

**`Regarding with testing also, since I am at beginner level with testing, there is much less testing codes that I implemented.`**
